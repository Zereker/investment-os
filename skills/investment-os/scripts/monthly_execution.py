"""Compute the month's funding decision from live account inputs — an executable
mirror of the published funding rules.

Why this exists: hand-deriving the funding computation from the docs is slow
(the target is 20 minutes) and lets two agents reach two different answers.
This closes that gap: same inputs -> same answer, every time.

Mirrors (any divergence from these files is a BUG in this script, not a new rule):
  skills/investment-os/references/00-constitution.md       targets, bands, cash floor, tiers
  skills/investment-os/references/02-monthly.md            deployment framework (D / S / B / drawdown),
                                                                 monthly gate order and routine-path checks

Hard boundaries this script will not cross:
  - It NEVER places or formats an executable order. Output is the published
    vocabulary only: HOLD / BUY CANDIDATE / REVIEW / DATA INCOMPLETE.
  - It NEVER writes account figures to disk. Values live in argv and stdout,
    never in the repo (public-repo privacy red line).
  - It NEVER invents inputs. Positions and NAV must come from IBKR; a missing
    input yields DATA INCOMPLETE, not a guess.
  - Which drawdown tiers already fired this cycle cannot be derived from price.
    Pass --tiers-executed; omitting it makes the script say so rather than assume.
  - This month's actual external contribution F cannot be derived from positions.
    Pass --contribution (0 for a no-deposit month); omitting it makes the Routine
    DCA path say DATA INCOMPLETE rather than silently deploying on an assumed F=0.

Usage (figures come from IBKR, in account currency; they are never persisted):
  python3 skills/investment-os/scripts/monthly_execution.py --nav 100000 --cash 18000 \\
      --spym 50000 --qqqm 26000 --soxx 6000 --contribution 2000

  # already deployed T1 earlier in this drawdown cycle:
  python3 skills/investment-os/scripts/monthly_execution.py ... --tiers-executed T1

  # skip the network call for the drawdown check (offline / IBKR series preferred):
  python3 skills/investment-os/scripts/monthly_execution.py ... --dd 0.0
